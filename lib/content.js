    overview: "Social isolation increases premature mortality by approximately 26%, comparable to smoking 15 cigarettes daily. For men, the absence of a partner and limited family contact drives a 15% increase in 20-year mortality risk. Social connection reduces cortisol, lowers inflammation markers (CRP, IL-6), and strengthens immune function.",
